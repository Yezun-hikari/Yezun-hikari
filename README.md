## *Hey there!*
I don't know how you landed on my profile but I guess now I have to tell you something about me :3

So let's get started. My name is Tim and I'm from GERMANY🇩🇪!
I really don't know anything about coding other than like ``print`` or something...
THAT'S WHY I am trying to do stuff with Jules ;-; !

#### Currently I am working on the AniWorld-Downloader, which is originally from these guys: *phoenixthrush, Tmaster055, SiroxCW*
I will maintain the tool as I for myself use the tool, because I am too broke for Crunchyroll :/
At the time of writing this I'm also "working" on the tool or how to call this. It's really frustrating to wait for the AI to do something, just to hear it say: "Oh sorry, I worked on it and tried to fix something, but I forgot to update the code."

So yeah...

That's me or so
